<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD student, candidate in the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering  (AAE) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), studenting in the XXX Lab, and my supervisor is Dr. XXX. 

In my research, I focus on the intersection between UAV / robot and control theory/machine learning, with the aim of developing algorithms that can endow agent safer, more efficient and economical. In particular, my research interests include control theory and reinforcement learning, with the application to control and decision-making.
